1.	In order to only print every third character printed you have to change the immediate in the “addi” instruction to 3 instead of 1. If you do this it will only print every third character, but it will also make the loop “useless” since it’s built for single step. On line 16 it instructs to “load immediate” to the temporary $t0 register, the starting immediate corresponds to [ which works if you only use single steps. But when you change the immediate (addi) to 3 it will never get the value corresponding to [ and on the next line where the bne instruction checks if equals  stop else  loop: It will just continue for ever. The solution is to change the immediate (li) to correspond to “]” instead which is 0x5d.
